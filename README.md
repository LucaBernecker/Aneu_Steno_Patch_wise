# Patch-Wise Deep Learning Method for Intracranial Stenosis and Aneurysm Detection-the Troms√∏ Study

In this repository we present the deep learning core that we invented for classification and detection for intracranial stenosis and aneurysm. The core is based on a 50ResNet, that is slided over the image as convolutional window.

Afterwards we make use of a simple deterministic voting algorithm to predict the location. And classify if there is a stenosis or aneurysm.
